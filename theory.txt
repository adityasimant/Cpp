There are two types of languages:
    1. procedure oriented 
    2. object oriented.

procedure : in this type, all code is divided into procedures(functs.)
    we concentrate on code in procedure oriented languages.
    eg. C

OOPs : Object is a real world entity that can be descibed by attributes and every
    object has actions.
    eg. Phones:
        attributes : company, OS, RAM, cost,camera, etc.
        actions : phone,sms etc

        Bulb :
        attributes: name ,watts,etc.
        actions: on/off.

class: class act as a blueprint for objects. In class we declare var. to 
    represnet attributes of object n we declare functs to represnet actions
    of the object.

    for eg. bilb , all attributes are var.
        and all actions are method or functs.
